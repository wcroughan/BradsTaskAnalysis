total time at location

Task
    full task raw vals might be different. Shows up also in diff with all but sym
    hometrial, other, cond - "home wells from X condition are revisited more often during other sessions"? Need to look at plot
    hometrial, other/next/later, diff - maybe driven by the above? Plot
    awaytrial, away/sym, cond - off wall wells have more time spent while searching for away. No home-specificity effect though
    awaytrial, later, diff - old homes from X condition sessions are checked more during following sessions' away trials
    hometrial t2-7, raw vals - No idea how these aren't just all 0
    awaytrial t2-7, away/sym diff - tended to hover around the home more in early away trials in condition X
    explore, other/later, cond - homes from X condition are revisited more in other sessions
    erode t0-1, later/other diff/cond - on first trial checking out previous home wells according to their condition
    erode t0-1, raw vals, how is not just zeros?
    awaytrial t10-15, all, cond/diff - no condition effects at all in later trials
    hometrial t10-15, sym, cond/diff - path optimality difference for home near end?
    
    don't look at
        explore off wall, complex confounding problems with excluded home well consumption time, and probably better periods to get at potentially interesting sections like away trials specifically
        hometrial t2-7, away, cond. I think would be getting at how often aways are checked on way to home, better ways of asking that
        same for diff

Probe
    filltime - clear home memory regardless of condition
    filltime, offwall, moving, away cond - in condition X, spends more time exploring in general
    filltime, offwall, moving, other cond - spends more time revisiting home wells from condition X (holds in later ctrl?)


    

Measure might want to add:
    how often are aways checked on way to home. Specifically t2-7
    How often are previously rewarded wells checked during away trials? Specifically t2-7
